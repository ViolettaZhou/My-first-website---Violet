#My first Website

Hi everyone, welcome to my github repo :blush:

This is the first website I've made after learning HTML and CSS for about 3 days from watching traversy media's videoes on Youtube (and reading some W3school tutorials)

The website explains what my name - "Violet" represents, as a flower, a color and a name :purple_heart:

It is a very simple one-page website but I hope you enjoy the design :smiley:

Thank you!
