                </div>
                <p> Violet is a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae. 
                    It is the largest genus in the family, containing between 525 and 600 species.
                    Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere; 
                    however, some are also found in widely divergent areas such as Hawaii, 
                    Australasia, and the Andes.
                    <br>
                    Some Viola species are perennial plants, some are annual plants, and a few are small shrubs.
                    Many species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their ornamental flowers(Wikipedia). </p>

                </div>
                <p> Violet is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light between blue and the invisible ultraviolet. 
                    Violet color has a dominant wavelength of approximately 380â€“450 nanometers.
                    Light with a shorter wavelength than violet but longer than X-rays and gamma rays is called ultraviolet. 
                    In the color wheel historically used by painters, it is located between blue and purple. 
                    On the screens of computer monitors and television sets, a color which looks similar to violet is made, 
                    with the RGB color model, by mixing red and blue light, with the blue twice as bright as the red. 
                    This is not true violet, for it does not match the color of a single wavelength shorter than 
                    that of blue light(Wikipedia).</p>
